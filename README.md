<h2>Project: CollegeScavs </h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>
    Existing marketplace platforms have problems with bot profiles, untrustworthy listings, and listings that require an inconvenient amount of travel for the buyer. To effectively mitigate this problem, CollegeScavs is limited to two main target audiences: students who are graduating/leaving and need to sell their belongings, and students who are entering or looking for furnishings and supplies to buy. 
</p>

<p>
    CollegeScavs is an online marketplace tool for students to sell and buy college related items for cheap and aims to solve the common problem of students throwing out unwanted items when they graduate, and incoming students having to buy school supplies, dorm essentials, and more at a high price.
</p>


<p>
    Students who are looking to get rid of their school supplies, furniture, and other college-related items can sign in and post listings for other students to find and buy. Incoming students, or any students looking to buy school supplies can find these listings, contact the student who created the listing, and set up a local exchange. This system ensures a trustworthy and local exchange for college students while also reducing waste and promoting sustainability.
